The US is more alone than ever, just at the moment the world needs its leadership


London (CNN)The United States is in uncharted territory, on an exponential path to becoming a Covid-19 pariah and an unreliable ally to its friends.

America's fall in global esteem is turning into an international horror show as the world watches the superpower struggle to match the efforts of many poorer nations to get the coronavirus pandemic under control.

Three-and-a-half years of President Donald Trump in office has changed America's international reputation and perhaps its future role in a way that seemed unimaginable when he took the oath of office on the steps of the US Capitol on January 20, 2017.
He set the tone in the drizzle that day: "We must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies, and destroying our jobs."
Trump's early decisions were deliberate, turbulent and at times seemed giddy.
Three days after his inauguration, he abandoned the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a potentially lucrative 12-nation Pacific trade deal. Executive Order 13769 swiftly followed, banning citizens of seven Muslim nations from travel to the US.

So when European Union leaders gathered in Malta for an emergency summit in February 2017, "America First" was very much on their minds. EU Council President Donald Tusk wrote to the bloc's leaders: "The change in Washington puts the European Union in a difficult situation; with the new administration seeming to put into question the last 70 years of American foreign policy."
Europe's matriarch and often its moral compass Angela Merkel declared: "Europe has its destiny in its own hands. And I believe the stronger we state clearly how we define our role in the world, the better we can take care with our transatlantic relations."

Three months later -- on his first overseas trip -- Trump proved Merkel right. At NATO HQ in Belgium, on May 25, the President not only roasted Merkel over Germany's performance on trade and attacked his allies for failing to meet NATO funding targets but showed shocking disdain for his peers, pushing past Montenegro's PM Dusko Markovic and giving a very frosty handshake to newly minted French President Emmanuel Macron.

His coup de grace at NATO HQ that day was failing to endorse the alliance's founding principle, its Article 5, under which it is obliged to protect each and every one of its members.
Three-and-a-half years of Trumpian vacillations later, NATO's upper echelons privately fear that a second Trump term could lead to "the effective end" of NATO. Those fears hit the front burner two weeks ago when Trump announced pulling 9,500 troops from bases in Germany. Angela Merkel had not been notified.
Last week one senior NATO source told me if Trump is re-elected it would be "extremely bad news" and could "fundamentally f**k up the alliance". It would not cease to exist but the concept of transatlantic deterrence would "no longer be fit for purpose."
What Trump is proposing, the source said, is "very real, it is a lot of troops." And it was emblematic of a larger problem, that "the US can't be relied on."
That vein of often mercurial unilateralism has been the trademark of Trump's first term. His doctrine of America-first, multilateralism-last has shifted Washington from being the global center of gravity that generations of American policymakers built, to an unreliable centrifugal force in danger of scattering democratic forces.

In capitals across the world, Trump's impact has become the endless hangover. The global village is in a semi-permanent spin, the geopolitical furniture rarely where it was the night before.
